# Backend – Django + Gunicorn

This is the backend for the IGen system, built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and a custom app called `igen`. It handles API routing, request logging, and proxies inference calls to the Stable Diffusion inference server. The backend is designed for deployment with Gunicorn and Render.

## Features

- Django REST API with custom `igen` app
- Proxies prompt/image requests to ML backend (Stable Diffusion server)
- Logs all requests and responses for traceability
- Deployed with Gunicorn (WSGI) on Render

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Database Migration

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Run Locally

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## Deployment (Render + Gunicorn)

- Use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) as the WSGI server:
  ```bash
  gunicorn backend.wsgi
  ```
- Configure Render to run migrations and start Gunicorn on deploy.
- Set environment variables (e.g., `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `ML_API_URL`).

---

## API Routing & Proxy

- All prompt/image requests are routed through Django and proxied to the Stable Diffusion inference server (e.g., on RunPod).
- Example endpoint: `/api/generate/`
- The backend handles authentication, logging, and error handling.

### Example Request/Response

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-backend-domain>/api/generate/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "A futuristic cityscape at sunset"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "image_url": "https://<your-backend-domain>/media/generated/abc123.png",
  "status": "success"
}
```

---

## Logging & Debugging

- All API requests and responses are logged by the `igen` app (see `models.py` and `views.py`).
- Logs can be viewed in the Render dashboard or server logs.
- For debugging, set `DEBUG=True` in environment variables (not recommended for production).
